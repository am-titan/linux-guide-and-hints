As of December of 2020, CentOS has turned into a product called CentOS Stream and is no longer the community enterprise distribution we have come to love for many years. With this, we will be transitioning a lot of stuff over into a Rocky Linux focused lense.

I am proud to be part of the Rocky Linux infrastructure team. I hope you can join us.
