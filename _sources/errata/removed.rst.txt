Wondering what happened to a removed article or information? This section will
explain what went missing and why.

Removed articles
----------------

12-17-2020

- training/ex294 was removed, as it was not a fit for this website and could
  not be modified to suit us and was missing credit to the original author.
  people who are training for the ex294 are encouraged to look for the EX407
  article on lisenet as it will be sufficient enough to train for the exam.

- misc/security was renamed to security/antipatterns.

11-17-2019

- Removed Blockify article because it is no longer maintained. Spotify prohibits
  ad blockers.
